DAY 1 TASK

                                                      A Difference between HTTP 1 VS HTTP 2

HTTP 1 :
        
             * Browsers Make Several Requets For One Piece of Information At a Time
             * It Repeats This Untill a web Page is Fully Loaded
             * This is Most Web Pages Loaded Slowly
             * Syntax and Semantics are Separeted
             * It Works on the Textual Formate
             * There is head of line Blocking the blocks Allthe requests Behind it until it Doesn't get its all resources
             * It compresses data by itself
             * It requests resources inlining for use getting multiple pages

HTTP 2 :

              * Browsers Requests Multiple pieces of the information at a Time
              * The server will them push them all at one when required
              * As a result it makes a website load Much Quicker
              * Addition of server push function (send related file without request)
              * It works on the Binary Protocal
              * It allows Multiplxing So one TCP connectin is requried for multiple requestes
              * It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
              * It uses HPACK for For data Compression
